Thanks to the list in [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness).


## Refresh-canvas
After learning Snake, I think it's good to read the git repo that provided the tutorials, [refresh-canvas](https://github.com/HustLion/refresh-canvas).

I think this is more of a Mako example.

* [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/): Mako is a template library written in Python.
* [jQuery UI](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/getting-started/): really marvelous... quickly a modern, elegant UI,,
* [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/): rsync is an open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer. [Tutorial in Chinese](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4b9b714a0100q34n.html)
* [PyYaml](http://pyyaml.org/)
* [a online editor for css](http://obsessing.org/)
* [algorithm ink](http://azarask.in/projects/algorithm-ink/#d3c3be13)
* [NodeBox](https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home): NodeBox is a Mac OS X application that lets you create 2D visuals (static, animated or interactive) using Python programming code and export them as a PDF or a QuickTime movie. NodeBox is free and well-documented.
* [Farbtastic](http://acko.net/blog/farbtastic-jquery-color-picker-plug-in/): Farbtastic is a jQuery plug-in that can add one or more color picker widgets into a page.
* [About static website generators](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/the-updated-big-list-of-static-website-generators-for-your-site-blog-or-wiki.html)
* [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/): I like [this](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/midnight/)

And, the presentation here is great... Excellent to teach coding. Can't imagine how we can finish it in MS PowerPoint or Prezi. Since we run code right on the page. By pressing `F11` in Firefox, it's quite great for presentation.

Try to understand existing mako demos and rebuild the presentation in Mako haha.

## jekyll sites to learn about

## Coffee-snake - coffee script
[Coffee-snake](https://github.com/HustLion/coffee-snake) is a great successor for the [snake](## learning - Snake - Web), which has github pages and gitmodules and coffee script. Consider it as a upgrade :).

## compiled - ArxLibertatis - C++
[ArxLibertatis](https://github.com/HustLion/ArxLibertatis) is a first-person role-playing game. And there is detailed comlipling [guide](http://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Downloading_and_Compiling_under_Linux) available, which is very helpful for me as a starter.

There are many dependencies to install which could be fun and expand my toolkit.

After compiling, I think, this is good for learning, but the quality of characters is not as high as commercial ones such as Resident Evil. It's sufficient for learning purpose, but can I find some really elegant games to learn?



### Notes:
CMakeList.txt seems quite important for cmake. Check it out later, [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2601798/adding-compiled-libraries-and-include-files-to-a-cmake-project).

[Find Freetype](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindFreetype.html)

The build failed with the info:

	CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:108 (message):
	Could NOT find Freetype (missing: FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS) (found version 11.0.5")

To resolve it, simply use:
	sudo apt-get install 

Shortcut to toggle windowed and fullscreen mode (default is Alt+Enter) 

### Resources:
* [FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/): FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts. Use `freetype-config` to check the version of the library that is installed on your system.
* [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/)
* [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/)
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

* [GDB](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
* Run arx in a debugger, [instructions](http://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Debugging)

### Bug found:

When the game is switched to fullscreen, the mouse moves too fast.


### Further Reading:
* [FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/) `autogen.sh`, `freetype-config` files.
* arx `arx-install-data` script, can be launched with a window, wonderful, have a look.
* arx developer doc. `make doc`->not working, `make style`-> valid. Also the [website](http://wiki.arx-libertatis.org/Developer_Information)
