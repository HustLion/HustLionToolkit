# Plan of learning
Thanks to the list in [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness).

I think I will start with interesting games:

## Snake
Browser based, really simple game as a start: [Snake](https://github.com/HustLion/snake), with this [tutorial](http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/index.html) which refers to more advanced material about [collision](http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/tutorialA.html). 

Some good resources: 
* [Web Reference](http://www.webreference.com/)
* [Mozilla Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial), which links to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) tutorials, really helpful.
* [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/): CodeMirror is a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser.
* [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/): an essential tool for any javascript developer. 
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/): Mako is a template library written in Python.

## Refresh-canvas
After learning Snake, I think it's good to read the git repo that provided the tutorials, [refresh-canvas](https://github.com/HustLion/refresh-canvas).

## Lila

A complex browser based chess game: [Lila](https://github.com/HustLion/lila)
